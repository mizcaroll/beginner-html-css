<strong>Apparently, 'strong' tag is now used to bold font in html and not 'b' as previously used </strong> <br/>
<em>Also, 'em' is now used to italicize in place of 'i'. This supposedly helps in rendering for mobile devices</em>

Having a cat can mean different things to different people. Some want a cat to cuddle and sit on their laps; others are happy to live with a very independent cat which spends most of its time outside and doesn’t want too much human interaction.
What is important is that you try to find a cat that will interact with you if you want it to. All cats are not the same and how each individual cat behaves with you can depend on its inherent personality and early experiences (or lack of experiences), which can make it fearful or confident with people and life in general.
The <span style="color: black;"> environment </span> in which you keep a cat is also extremely significant – for example if it lives with many other cats which do not get on, then it will be stressed and will react differently than if it was on its own.
